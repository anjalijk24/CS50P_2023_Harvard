#Assignment: implement a function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats below and returns the
#corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein)
#and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM
#and 5:00 PM specifically.

    #9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
    #9 AM to 5 PM

#Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats or if either time is invalid
#(e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). But do not assume that someoneâ€™s hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem;
#someone might work late and even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
