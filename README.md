# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard University's "CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python" course on edX. I utilized both CS50's IDE and Visual Studio Code on my macOS to complete these assignments.

## Course Overview

The coursework comprises ten modules, each with its corresponding problem set (PS):

0. **Functions, Variables** - PS0
1. **Conditionals** - PS1
2. **Loops** - PS2
3. **Exceptions** - PS3
4. **Libraries** - PS4
5. **Unit Tests** - PS5
6. **File I/O** - PS6
7. **Regular Expressions** - PS7
8. **Object-Oriented Programming** - PS8
9. **Et Cetera** - Project (Final Assignment)

## Tools Used

- **CS50's IDE:** Used for initial development and testing.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Utilized for additional development and refinement.

## Folder Structure

- Each module has its own dedicated folder containing the relevant problem set solutions.
- The final project solution is located in the "Et Cetera" folder.
