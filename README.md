# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard University's "CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python" course on edX. I utilized both CS50's IDE and Visual Studio Code on my macOS to complete these assignments.

## Course Overview

The coursework comprises ten modules, each with its corresponding problem set (PS):

| Module Name                       | Problem Set     |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Functions, Variables              | PS0             |
| Conditionals                      | PS1             |
| Loops                             | PS2             |
| Exceptions                        | PS3             |
| Libraries                         | PS4             |
| Unit Tests                        | PS5             |
| File I/O                          | PS6             |
| Regular Expressions               | PS7             |
| Object-Oriented Programming       | PS8             |
| Et Cetera                         | project         |

## Tools Used

- **CS50's IDE:** Used for initial development and testing.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Utilized for additional development and refinement.

## Folder Structure

- Each module has its own dedicated folder containing the relevant problem set solutions.
- The final project solution is located in the "project" folder.
